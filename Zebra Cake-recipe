Mix it very well with wisk/hand mixer. Add the dry ingredients in the wet ingredients.
Divide the batter equally in 2 bowls.Add coco powder in one mixture and vanilla essence in another mixture and mix well.
Now, the creative part starts. Spoon two tablespoons of the vanilla mixture into the center of the cake tin. Straight away spoon two tablespoons of the chocolate mixture on top. Continue doing this until all the mixture has been used. You will end up with lots of alternate rings of mixture in the tin.
